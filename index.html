			<td>Michael Jordan is a retired American basketball player, team owner, product endorser and entrepreneur. Michael Jordan's net worth is $2.2 billion. Michael Jordan is still, quite possibly, the most popular basketball player on the planet. Michael Jordan is the player and person against which all other up-and-comers are measured. The press is forever searching for the "next Michael Jordan", and every season, a new player is crowned (or saddled) with the title. In the meantime, Michael Jordan continues to enjoy his semi-retirement, his multiple endorsement and development deals, and his reputation as the greatest basketball player of all time.</td>

			<td>Vince McMahon is an American professional wrestling promoter, commentator, film producer and occasional wrestler who has a net worth of $1.8 billion. Vince McMahon earned his fortune and fame as the CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, more commonly known as WWE. He is the company's largest individual shareholder. We detail his exact equity stake size and value later in the next paragraph. In the wake of an ongoing sexual harassment scandal, Vince McMahon announced he was retiring from WWE on July 22, 2022. In January 2023 Vince returned to WWE as Executive Chairman.</td>

			<td>Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock, is an American actor, former professional wrestler and entrepreneur who has a net worth of $800 million. That net worth includes what we believe is The Rock's 30-40% stake in Teremana Tequila and a current $2 billion conservative estimate valuation of the brand. In theory, The Rock could make over $1 billion from the tequila company. That would be more than he has ever made in his entire entertainment career. Outside of tequila, The Rock is one of the highest-paid entertainers on the planet. In a typical year he earns at least $100 million from his various film and endorsement endeavors. More details on The Rock's earnings, assets, investments and real estate later in this article.</td>
